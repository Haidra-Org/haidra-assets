# What is the AI-Horde?

AI Horde is a free community service that lets anyone create AI-generated images and text. In the spirit of projects like  SETI@home (where people contribute their computers to search for alien signals) or  Folding@home (sharing compute for medical research), AI Horde lets volunteers share their computer power to help others create AI art and writing.

When you make a request - like asking for "a painting of a sunset over mountains" - the AI Horde system finds available volunteer computers that can handle your task. It's similar to how ride-sharing apps connect passengers with nearby drivers, but instead of rides, you're getting AI-generated content.

The system uses "kudos" points to keep things fair. Volunteers earn kudos when their computers help process requests, which they can use to get priority for their own requests or leave unspent to help others. Importantly, kudos can never be bought or sold - this is strictly against the Terms of Service. 

What makes AI Horde special is that it's completely free and community-run, with a strong commitment to staying that way. The kudos system is specifically designed to ensure that access to these resources remains equitable. While users with more kudos get faster service, anyone can use it, even anonymously, and kudos never expire.

The AI-Horde hopes to ensure that everyone gets a chance to use these exciting AI technologies, regardless of their financial means or technical resources.
