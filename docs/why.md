# AI-Horde Motivations

## Why do you run the AI-Horde?

The AI-Horde hopes to expand availability of open-source generative AI, machine learning technologies and any other frontier compute-intensive technology. We are committed to offering this service to the general public, for free, for the purpose of public benefit. We believe that generative AI, as well as other related emerging technologies, have the potential to provide enormous artistic, technical, and educational benefit to everyone. Unfortunately, these technologies are (generally speaking) computationally expensive and may be out of reach for many. We aim to improve access to these and other audiences. 

## Do you profit?

The AI-Horde relies entirely on volunteer development effort, donation and public participation. We operate on a not-for-profit basis and do not disperse any excess funds for personal benefit.

## Why only open-source technologies?

The primary focus of the AI-Horde is to democratize access to technologies. Closed-source models do not align with that vision. We believe that machine-learning technologies have been built on the back of many years of open-source and openly-available technologies and that they should remain that way for academic benefit. We believe that helping foster open-source development and collaboration is the best way to ensure continued transparent growth in the AI space.
